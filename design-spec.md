#### Adding expenses

- [x] (option 1):

- who paid
- for what
- for whom
- how much
  It gets split uniformly among people selected in the "for whom" step

- [x] (option 2):

- who paid
- for what
- add specific costs per person
  Eg. John paid the bill at the restaurant and inputs that Mary's meal was $9, and Tom's was $7.30.
  So the total expense is calculated as $16.30, but it is not split equally among Tom and Mary.
